      "Just added one at A 9,000-year-old skeleton was discovered inside a cave in Cheddar, England, and was affectionately dubbed \"Cheddar Man.\" DNA testing confirmed that a living relative lived approximately half a mile away, tracing their lineage back nearly 300 generations.  In 1903, while conducting excavations in Cheddar Gorge, Somerset, UK, researchers stumbled upon a remarkable find: the skeletal remains of a Homo sapien who had lived around 9,000 years ago. This individual ranks among the oldest modern humans ever found in Britain. The discovery occurred serendipitously during a drainage renovation within the tourist attraction of Gough's Cave.  Cheddar Man thrived during the Mesolithic period roughly 9,000 years ago. Most likely, he was a hunter-gatherer who passed away in his twenties and stood at a height of approximately 5 feet, 5 inches.  The use of cutting-edge technology has enabled researchers to reconstruct Cheddar Man's facial features, determine his skin and eye coloring, and even discern the texture of his hair. Genetic material extracted from one of Cheddar Man's molar teeth allowed scientists to identify Adrian Targett, a retired history teacher, as a relative.  Upon analysis, it was revealed that Targett's family lineage had endured in the Cheddar Gorge region for approximately nine millennia, with genes passed from mother to daughter through mitochondrial DNA, inherited from the egg.  In simple terms, Adrian Targett and Cheddar Man share a common maternal ancestor. and care.virtue\n",

      "Just added one at A 9,000-year-old skeleton was discovered inside a cave in Cheddar, England, and was affectionately dubbed \"Cheddar Man.\" DNA testing confirmed that a living relative lived approximately half a mile away, tracing their lineage back nearly 300 generations.  In 1903, while conducting excavations in Cheddar Gorge, Somerset, UK, researchers stumbled upon a remarkable find: the skeletal remains of a Homo sapien who had lived around 9,000 years ago. This individual ranks among the oldest modern humans ever found in Britain. The discovery occurred serendipitously during a drainage renovation within the tourist attraction of Gough's Cave.  Cheddar Man thrived during the Mesolithic period roughly 9,000 years ago. Most likely, he was a hunter-gatherer who passed away in his twenties and stood at a height of approximately 5 feet, 5 inches.  The use of cutting-edge technology has enabled researchers to reconstruct Cheddar Man's facial features, determine his skin and eye coloring, and even discern the texture of his hair. Genetic material extracted from one of Cheddar Man's molar teeth allowed scientists to identify Adrian Targett, a retired history teacher, as a relative.

      "Just added one at BREAKING: Shocking scandal rocks MAGA world as authorities arrest Fabian Marta — the man who funded the QAnon child trafficking movie \"Sound of Freedom\" that has been the toast of Republican circles for weeks now — for one of the worst crimes imaginable.  You won't believe this one...  Conservatives have been obsessed with Sound of Freedom, a movie that tells the lie-riddled but supposedly true story of a man chasing down pedophiles and international child traffickers.   The movie has struck a cord with deranged conservatives who believe that Democrats are all blood-drinking Satanic child molesters and has racked in $155 million so far.   Prominent Republicans and Fox News have praised the awful film for \"spreading awareness\" about child trafficking despite it being chock-full of fabrications.  The film was at least partially funded by a man named Fabian Marta. He bragged that he helped get the movie financed and made after Disney refused to release it.  Now, Marta has been outed as one of the villains from his own movie. According to the Missouri Courts website, he was arrested on July 21 for felony child kidnapping. He has also been accused of hosting predatory \"sugar baby\" events.  While the full details of Marta's child kidnapping case have yet to emerge, it certainly seems that his role in getting Sound of Freedom made was an act of profound psychological projection.

      "Just added one at BREAKING: Shocking scandal rocks MAGA world as authorities arrest Fabian Marta — the man who funded the QAnon child trafficking movie \"Sound of Freedom\" that has been the toast of Republican circles for weeks now — for one of the worst crimes imaginable.  You won't believe this one...  Conservatives have been obsessed with Sound of Freedom, a movie that tells the lie-riddled but supposedly true story of a man chasing down pedophiles and international child traffickers.   The movie has struck a cord with deranged conservatives who believe that Democrats are all blood-drinking Satanic child molesters and has racked in $155 million so far.   Prominent Republicans and Fox News have praised the awful film for \"spreading awareness\" about child trafficking despite it being chock-full of fabrications.  The film was at least partially funded by a man named Fabian Marta. He bragged that he helped get the movie financed and made after Disney refused to release it.  Now, Marta has been outed as one of the villains from his own movie. According to the Missouri Courts website, he was arrested on July 21 for felony child kidnapping. He has also been accused of hosting predatory \"sugar baby\" events.  While the full details of Marta's child kidnapping case have yet to emerge, it certainly seems that his role in getting Sound of Freedom made was an act of profound psychological projection.

      "Just added one at BREAKING: Shocking scandal rocks MAGA world as authorities arrest Fabian Marta — the man who funded the QAnon child trafficking movie \"Sound of Freedom\" that has been the toast of Republican circles for weeks now — for one of the worst crimes imaginable.  You won't believe this one...  Conservatives have been obsessed with Sound of Freedom, a movie that tells the lie-riddled but supposedly true story of a man chasing down pedophiles and international child traffickers.   The movie has struck a cord with deranged conservatives who believe that Democrats are all blood-drinking Satanic child molesters and has racked in $155 million so far.   Prominent Republicans and Fox News have praised the awful film for \"spreading awareness\" about child trafficking despite it being chock-full of fabrications.  The film was at least partially funded by a man named Fabian Marta. He bragged that he helped get the movie financed and made after Disney refused to release it.  Now, Marta has been outed as one of the villains from his own movie. According to the Missouri Courts website, he was arrested on July 21 for felony child kidnapping. He has also been accused of hosting predatory \"sugar baby\" events.  While the full details of Marta's child kidnapping case have yet to emerge, it certainly seems that his role in getting Sound of Freedom made was an act of profound psychological projection.

      "Just added one at CEO of Anheuser-Busch has now blamed social media users for “misinformation and disinformation” after the beer brand lost $6 billion in stock value.   CEO Michael Doukeris claimed that the Dylan Mulvaney campaign “was not an advertisement” - despite the fact Dylan’s instagram listed it as a paid partnership.   He said of the social media boycott campaign:   “You have one fact and every person puts an opinion behind the fact. And then the opinions start to be replicated fast on each and every comment. By the time that 10 or 20 people put a comment out there, the reality is no longer what the fact is, but is more (about) what the comments were.”   Anheuser-Busch stocks came crashing down after Dylan Mulvaney posted the paid partnership to his instagram. The brand has lost 26.1% of value vs the same period last year.   Source:  @DailyMail and sanctity.vice\n",

Saddest part is they gave the robot the ability to do these 'happy dances' to spectators. When the project was first launched it danced around spending most of its time interacting with the crowd since it could quickly pull back the small spillage. Many years later... (as you see it now in the video) it looks tired and hopeless as there isn't enough time to dance anymore.. It now only has enough time to try to keep itself alive as the amount of leaked hydraulic fluid became unmanageable as the spill grew over time.

How this robs us of our happiness, passion and our inner peace. How we are slowly drowning with more responsibilities, with more expected of us, less rewarding pay-offs and less free time to enjoy ourselves with as the years go by. How there's really no escaping the system and that we were destined at birth to follow a pretty specific path that was already laid out before us. How we can give and give and give and how easily we can be forgotten after we've gone..

      "Just added one at SHOCKING: New Study proves Pfizer mRNA induced turbo cancer  In a new Belgian study by Sander Eens et al. they injected 14 mice with 2 Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.  2 days after 2nd Pfizer dose, 1/14 mice (7%) died suddenly, had turbo cancer with lymphoma infiltration of many organs: liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs & intestines.  The turbo cancer mouse had shown no clinical signs of illness before sudden death.  This is the 2nd study to show turbo cancer after Pfizer mRNA vaccination.   These were the types of studies that Pfizer & Moderna should have performed on mice but never did.  Key point: This 14 mouse study was larger than the study done to approve COVID-19 Omicron bivalent mRNA booster shots which were given to 100s of millions of people - that study only had 8 mice.

      "Just added one at The Fed just announced it will introduce its “FedNow” Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in July. CBDCs grease the slippery slope to financial slavery and political tyranny.  While cash transactions are anonymous, a #CBDC will allow the government to surveil all our private financial affairs. The central bank will have the power to enforce dollar limits on our transactions restricting where you can send money, where you can spend it, and when money expires.  A CBDC tied to digital ID and social credit score will allow the government to freeze your assets or limit your spending to approved vendors if you fail to comply with arbitrary diktats, i.e. vaccine mandates.  The Fed will initially limit its CBDC to interbank transactions but we should not be blind to the obvious danger that this is the first step in banning and seizing bitcoin as the Treasury did with gold 90 years ago today in 1933.
