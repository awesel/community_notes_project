The CDC has been lying to people for over 20 years in denying the link between vaccines and autism. In just 40 minutes after launching my survey, I now have a highly statistically significant result. 

If you are unvaccinated vs. 10 or more vaccines, you have a 6X lower chance of being diagnosed with autism. The result is highly statistically significant (p=.0023). I'll make the data public tomorrow (Andy Wakefield and others already have it). 

Nobody should be surprised. The Mawson study and Hooker study (both published in peer-reviewed journals and not retracted) both showed very similar values (4X and 5X respectively).

All the data is verifiable. My study is larger and more diverse than theirs.

Any mainstream media ""fact checker"" want to check the facts? The whole thing was done in full public view.

The CDC had 20 years to run the same survey I did. It only took me about 2 hours to write and debug it. I'll publicly release the data tomorrow for everyone to analyze. Maybe the CDC can make the signal go away through clever subgroup analysis.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The Mawson study has, in fact, been retracted.

Experts agree improving our tree canopy is one of the best ways we can fight climate change. We must fully fund Parks operations and pick up the pace today!

‘KAREN’ STOLE MY BIKE?

A video’s gone viral of what appears to be a woman in New York trying to steal a pre-paid Citi Bike - and then playing the victim. It’s been flagged by prominent Black civil-rights defenders as another case of a White woman playing the race card in a sinister way, as she seems to make out that she’s being threatened - by the person who’d paid for the bike and his friends, a group of Black men. It’s re-ignited online discussion of so-called ‘Karens’ - a pejorative term that’s gained currency to refer to self-entitled White women, including those who exploit White privilege or racial stereotyping. A prominent case was a few years back in New York’s Central Park, when a woman was filmed crying out for help, claiming that an African-American man was trying to attack her, when in fact he’d just asked her to put her dog back on the lead.

No more legacy admissions. 

No more special admissions for people who've been coached extensively to be good at aristocratic sports.

If the CDC, Democrats, & media cared about #COVID, they would work as hard as possible to:

•End Obesity - 80% of covid hospitalization & deaths.

•Close the Border - stop spread of disease.

•Study & Promote Effective Treatments like HCQ & More.

But they care about control.

I have talked to multiple women who say they miscarried healthy pregnancies after taking the #COVID19 vaccine.

Not only miscarriages, but also reporting blood clots and heavy & irregular periods after taking the Experimental Use Covid vaccine.

Arizonans have no Faith & Trust in our Elections. 

Our Election Officials are incompetent (…or worse)
They have failed us. 

The Fake News ignores our Fake Elections and expect us to just “move on.”

We won’t.

Tesla is a profoundly RACIST company, that makes an overpriced car that looks like a suppository. 

You have better priced, better looking, better performing, and better behaving choices out there.

When President Biden took office, millions were unemployed and there was no vaccine available.
 
In the last 15 months, the economy has created 8.3M jobs and the unemployment rate stands at 3.6% — the fastest decline in unemployment to start a President's term ever recorded.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The Pfizer vaccine was approved by the FDA by December 11, 2020, and was available that month.  This was a full month before Joe Biden took office.

Weird how Andrew Tate being swatted for alleged human trafficking causes celebration from the left yet they’re still silent about Epstein’s client list.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
This tweet is false.
The term “swatting” refers to the practice of making an intentionally false report to police in order to elicit a forceful and potentially violent police response.
Tate was detained as a result of a real investigation into conduct he himself described:

Oppenheimer brought us The Bomb... and sweet corn.

Corn seeds were deliberately exposed to US atomic bomb tests in 1946, just to see what would happen. Dr. John Laughnan was sorting that mutant corn & absentmindedly ate a kernel, discovering its sweet flavor, which he then bred.

This newly built Las Vegas sphere cost $2.3 billion and uses 150 terawatt-hours of electricity per year to power the massive screen.

That's almost double the yearly power consumption of Bitcoin.

This extraordinary claims lacks any evidence.

""580,000-square-foot LED canvas"" 
edm.com/news/vegas-sph…

Even with a pessimistic estimate of 100 watts per square foot, we get 58 mega  (58 x 10^6) watts. Far shy of Bitcoin's estimated 127 terra (127 x 10^ 12) watts.

My strategy to defeat guns in America is as follows.

Start with a mandatory natl. gun and ammo registry. Guns must be visibly marked with their serial numbers so they are visible even when holstered.

Then ban new weapons that aren't biocoded for safety reasons.

How to get gun control legislation fast in the US?
Easy. Fundraise a ton of $ and arm EVERY black and latino boy/man over 18 with an AR-15 and force the states to install open carry laws. 
Within months there would be restrictive gun laws in place.

Americans gained an average of 29 pounds during the Covid lockdowns. I will help turn this around by encouraging our citizens to exercise, eat well, and fortify their immune systems by removing harmful chemicals from our food.
Readers added context
According to a 2021 APA survey, 42% of Americans gained un-desired weight during the lockdowns, with the average weight gain of those individuals being 29lbs.
Not average weight gain per American.

@RobertKennedyJr
Since the assassination of my father in 1968, candidates for president are provided Secret Service protection.  But not me.
 
Typical turnaround time for pro forma protection requests from presidential candidates is 14-days.  After 88-days of no response and after several follow-ups by our campaign, the Biden Administration just denied our request.  Secretary Mayorkas: ""I have determined that Secret Service protection for Robert F Kennedy Jr is not warranted at this time.""
 Our campaign's request included a 67-page report from the world's leading protection firm, detailing unique and well established security and safety risks aside from commonplace death threats.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The Secret Service does not provide protection to non-incumbent Presidential candidates until 120 days before the general election.

The next election is Nov. 5, 2024.
July 8, 2024 is 120 days prior.

A 9,000-year-old skeleton was discovered inside a cave in Cheddar, England, and was affectionately dubbed ""Cheddar Man."" DNA testing confirmed that a living relative lived approximately half a mile away, tracing their lineage back nearly 300 generations.

In 1903, while conducting excavations in Cheddar Gorge, Somerset, UK, researchers stumbled upon a remarkable find: the skeletal remains of a Homo sapien who had lived around 9,000 years ago. This individual ranks among the oldest modern humans ever found in Britain. The discovery occurred serendipitously during a drainage renovation within the tourist attraction of Gough's Cave.

Cheddar Man thrived during the Mesolithic period roughly 9,000 years ago. Most likely, he was a hunter-gatherer who passed away in his twenties and stood at a height of approximately 5 feet, 5 inches.

The use of cutting-edge technology has enabled researchers to reconstruct Cheddar Man's facial features, determine his skin and eye coloring, and even discern the texture of his hair. Genetic material extracted from one of Cheddar Man's molar teeth allowed scientists to identify Adrian Targett, a retired history teacher, as a relative.

Upon analysis, it was revealed that Targett's family lineage had endured in the Cheddar Gorge region for approximately nine millennia, with genes passed from mother to daughter through mitochondrial DNA, inherited from the egg.

In simple terms, Adrian Targett and Cheddar Man share a common maternal ancestor.

Again, the Manhattan DA is charging a man who defended himself with attempted murder.

Remember, if someone shoots you, you have to just take it. You cannot defend yourself in any way, and you certainly cannot disarm your assailant after being shot and use his weapon against him.

Progressives want you completely defenseless and at the mercy of murderers, fearing for your life and fearing for your freedom should you try to protect yourself. 

It is a complete moral inversion, and you have Alvin Bragg and our progressive establishment to thank for it.

Elon Musk paid $0 in federal taxes in 2018.

If he can afford Twitter, he can damn well afford to pay his fair share in taxes. We need a Billionaire Tax NOW.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
Per ProPublica, Musk did not pay federal income tax in 2018.

In fairness he did pay significant federal income tax in 2021 when he exercised stock options expiring in 2022.

Remember when they spent years telling us to panic over the hole in the ozone layer and then suddenly just stopped talking about it and nobody ever mentioned the ozone layer again?
Readers added context
24 nations signed the Montreal Protocol limiting the use of CFCs in 1987. Scientists estimate that if the Montreal Protocol had never been implemented, the hole would have grown by 40 percent by 2013. Instead, the hole is expected to completely heal by 2050.

Il costo della benzina aumenta anche perché il Governo Meloni ha aumentato le accise rispetto al Governo Draghi. Questa è la verità. E lo ha fatto mentre stanziava 890 milioni di € a favore delle società di serie A. Io sono stato il primo a denunciarlo e mi sono preso gli insulti dei tifosi.

È improprio affermare che sono state “aumentate le accise”. Dal primo gennaio 2023 è venuto meno lo sconto deciso dal Governo Draghi, prima ridotto a novembre ‘22 e poi azzerato da gennaio ‘23. Le accise non sono aumentate, è stato tolto lo sconto temporaneo. quattroruote.it/news/industria…

Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.

Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
Multiple advertisers have confirmed they are pausing spending while they see what direction Elon Musk takes with the platform.

Y’all know that vaccine ain’t approved by the FDA right?
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
This is misleading. The COVID-19 vaccines are fully authorized by FDA scientists, and recommended by the CDC.

The term ""FDA approved"" has a technical legal meaning. The vaccines aren't ""FDA approved"" yet, but that's only because they went through a different legal process.

To the gentle lady from Colorado, as someone who was incapable of getting into college yourself, you’re neither qualified nor competent to comment on the topic of student loans for college. 

And since you brought up the topic of taxpayers paying for loans, let’s discuss how your buddy Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene had $183,504 in PPP loans forgiven.

This was all money from taxpayers that wasn’t paid back. 

Why is it ok for her, but not for poor people trying to better themselves through education? 

Finally, you call this a victory for personal responsibility…

Maybe someone who just became a grandma at 36 shouldn’t be lecturing the rest of us about personal responsibility.

You cannot “cancel” student loans any more than you can cancel a car payment or credit card debt. That money has to come from somewhere.

Proponents of this literally wanted student loan debt transferred to other people. It’s obnoxious.

JUST IN: The Biden Department of 'Justice' is suing Elon Musk's SpaceX for refusing to hire refugees and asylum seekers.

Musk should change his name to Hunter Biden and coerce foreign entities to get rich so the DOJ ignores him.

“The lawsuit alleges that, from at least September 2018 to May 2022, SpaceX routinely discouraged asylees and refugees from applying and refused to hire or consider them, because of their citizenship status, in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act,” the Justice Department said.

“Our investigation found that SpaceX failed to fairly consider or hire asylees and refugees because of their citizenship status and imposed what amounted to a ban on their hire regardless of their qualification, in violation of federal law,” US Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said.

Our selective justice system strikes again.

This is in fact unedited legitimate footage from a Joe Biden speech which took place on 2/28/23.

The politically-motivated Left failed miserably in their attempt to destroy me. They’re now trying to falsely discredit me by saying I admitted I lied.

That is FALSE. I would NEVER lie. Lying requires INTENTIONALLY making a false statement.

I never did that, nor did I stipulate to or admit that.

As has become sadly typical, the opposition-controlled media is intentionally twisting the truth, conflating the full RPC standard with the actual stipulation. The standard reads, “dishonesty, fraud, deceit, OR misrepresentation.”

The Colorado bar counsel and my counsel concluded that it was best to resolve the bar complaints by agreeing to a public censure.

Bar complaints have been filed all over the country by people Trump lawyers have never met, had no client relationship with, and who are totally partisan against Trump. This is and always was political lawfare to intimidate lawyers from representing Trump or Republicans candidates, especially in election challenges and try to destroy our livelihood and reputation. Organizations filing complaints have been open about this motivation.

I am grateful to have this behind me, thankful to the Colorado OARC and the PDJ for treating me fairly in spite of immense political pressure and to my lawyers who have stood by me and given me wise counsel, and I remain in good standing and fully licensed in the State of Colorado.

I’ll continue speaking truth to the best of my ability and zealously advocating for due process, having learned I can do so in media even more carefully, while NEVER backing down to the political opposition mob who would seek to destroy me, my vocation, my mission, and my voice.

Not today. Not ever.

BREAKING: Shocking scandal rocks MAGA world as authorities arrest Fabian Marta — the man who funded the QAnon child trafficking movie ""Sound of Freedom"" that has been the toast of Republican circles for weeks now — for one of the worst crimes imaginable.

You won't believe this one...

Conservatives have been obsessed with Sound of Freedom, a movie that tells the lie-riddled but supposedly true story of a man chasing down pedophiles and international child traffickers. 

The movie has struck a cord with deranged conservatives who believe that Democrats are all blood-drinking Satanic child molesters and has racked in $155 million so far. 

Prominent Republicans and Fox News have praised the awful film for ""spreading awareness"" about child trafficking despite it being chock-full of fabrications.

The film was at least partially funded by a man named Fabian Marta. He bragged that he helped get the movie financed and made after Disney refused to release it.

Now, Marta has been outed as one of the villains from his own movie. According to the Missouri Courts website, he was arrested on July 21 for felony child kidnapping. He has also been accused of hosting predatory ""sugar baby"" events.

While the full details of Marta's child kidnapping case have yet to emerge, it certainly seems that his role in getting Sound of Freedom made was an act of profound psychological projection.

Isn't that always the case with Republicans? They accuse of others of doing what they themselves are guilty of.

This man must be locked up. Children are at risk.

Please retweet and  if you believe Marta belongs in prison — and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a “woke” new Twitter competitor that banned Trump for life and is exploding in popularity because Elon Musk banned Tribel’s Twitter account — but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: http://tribel.app.link/okwPIHYCIqb

What hypocrites!
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
Elon Musk’s claim that the quote on the NPR website about federal funding was “taken down” is false. 

The NPR website still states that “Federal funding is essential to public radio's service to the American public” under the heading “Public Radio and Federal Funding.”

People died or were severely injured because of bad science.  It didn't have to be that way.
For those of us physicians and scientists who were metaphorically ""burned at the stake"" for stating these facts years ago, there is no justice.  Heck, most of us are still completely banned (linked in) or shadow banned on most social media platforms. We will never get our careers back. The damage done is significant. 
But people died from remdesivir.  Never forget that the government did that.  It was all about regulatory capture.

Ian, that’s a 1944 statute called the Public Health Services Act. Too old to be binding law on modern commercial air carriers.

CEO of Anheuser-Busch has now blamed social media users for “misinformation and disinformation” after the beer brand lost $6 billion in stock value. 

CEO Michael Doukeris claimed that the Dylan Mulvaney campaign “was not an advertisement” - despite the fact Dylan’s instagram listed it as a paid partnership. 

He said of the social media boycott campaign: 

“You have one fact and every person puts an opinion behind the fact. And then the opinions start to be replicated fast on each and every comment. By the time that 10 or 20 people put a comment out there, the reality is no longer what the fact is, but is more (about) what the comments were.” 

Anheuser-Busch stocks came crashing down after Dylan Mulvaney posted the paid partnership to his instagram. The brand has lost 26.1% of value vs the same period last year.

Ukrainian President Zelensky, who met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Saturday, broke most of the rules of etiquette. In particular, he did not miss the pontiff at the entrance to his office.
 “When Zelensky arrived at the Vatican, after greeting the Pope, both went to the pontiff’s office. However, Zelensky will not let the pontiff go ahead, but squeezed into the office right in front of him, ” writes Exxpress.
The publication indicates that Zelensky sat in a chair, although the Pope was still standing. He, sitting, accepted a handshake from one of the advisers to the pontiff.
 At the meeting, the Kiev leader took the liberty of correcting Francis' speech.

  THREE Trillium Health Partners-Mississauga Hospital doctors have DIED suddenly in 1 week, apparently after getting latest mandated booster. Cause of deaths is not yet disclosed. How often have 3 doctors died, days after hospitals started giving 4th shot to hospital staff.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
Two of the doctors who died had previously been diagnosed with cancer, according to an obituary and media reports. The third doctor had been seriously ill, though his diagnosis was not disclosed.

ゆうちょ銀行が経済を回すことに貢献していないかの表現は、誤解を生みます。

法人への融資は、民業を圧迫するという銀行協会の意見。融資や回収といった能力が十分備わっていない等の金融庁や総務省の意見もあり、今も完全な認可は降りていません。
zenginkyo.or.jp/news/2020/n122…
j-cast.com/2017/03/042920…

しかし、住宅ローン・口座貸越サービス・貯金担保自動貸付け等、一部の業務については認可を受け、事業を行っています。

fsa.go.jp/news/r2/yuusei…

また、ゆうちょ銀行に集まった貯金等は、資金運用という形で市場へ大規模に投入されています。今後は、地域産業やベンチャーへも投資していくと発表。融資については既に過当競争との見解も発表。

Readers added context they thought people might want to know
乳幼児、子供の予防接種対象に指定される病気は、かかってしまうと致死率が高かったり、後遺症が残ってしまう病気で、ワクチン接種によりリスクを低減できます(※1)

これらの予防接種は、母から乳児が受け継いだ免疫が落ちる時期、病気のかかりやすさや重症化しやすい年齢などに応じて適切な時期、回数が指定されています(※2)

母子手帳は接種時期、接種状況の記録に役立ちます。活用して忘れずに接種しましょう。

岸田首相の会見の最後で声を上げ、核軍縮ビジョンについて最前列から問いました。岸田氏は事前に決まっていた4社の質問に答えただけだったので、「事前に決まっていた4社以外にも答えて欲しい。核軍縮ビジョンについて質問させて下さい」と訴えましたが、それでも答えてくれず、「逃げるんですか」とさらに問いました。すると、岸田氏は戻ってきて回答。ただ、首相は核軍縮ビジョンについて、自分の宣伝したい見解を強調しただけでした。私はさらに「核を認める宣言がここで出てしまった、この広島でそんな宣言を出したのは大きな間違いだったのではないか」と問いましたが、首相はそのまま立ち去りました。

今回の核軍縮ビジョンには、米中露英仏の核5大国が昨年1月に出した「核兵器の防衛目的の役割、侵略の抑止、戦争の防止」の効果、をうたった声明と全く同じ英語の文言が盛り込まれ、核軍縮とは名ばかりで、実質は米国主導の核兵器容認声明になっています。

核廃絶のシンボルである広島で、核の抑止力や役割をうたった5大国の昨年1月の声明内容や論理がそのまま盛り込まれたのは、歴史に残る事態です。その点を、首相にきちんと質したかったのですが、首相は私の声かけには戻ってきたものの、マイクできちんと質問させてもらえず、首相は核軍縮ビジョンについての一方的な見解述べただけで終わってしまい、非常に残念でした。

官邸が事前にシナリオを決め、それを日本のプレスも外国プレスも容認しているのはあまりにもおかしいと思います。WHでの大統領会見などG7の首脳会見に私は何度も出てきましたが、日本の首相記者会見は、G7で最低だと感じます。

原発処理水の放出にお墨付き…IAEAは本当に「中立」か 日本は巨額の分担金、電力業界も人員派遣

IAEAはどこまで信を置けるのか。かねて日本政府は、IAEAに巨額の分担金や拠出金を支出してきた。IAEAのお墨付きは、中立的な立場から出たと受け止めるべきか？

https://tokyo-np.co.jp/article/261656

国際機関には加盟国の義務的拠出金があり、経済規模に基づくためアメリカ、中国に次ぐ第3位です（2020年）。2021年に派遣された日本人の職員数は41人、全職員2550人のうちの1.6％に過ぎません。幹部以上は1人のみ。

Twitter is enforcing its long-standing API rules. That may result in some apps not working.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
Currently it's all major third party clients not some. Also, it is unknown what long standing rules have been broken as no guidance has been provided to any API partner. And as the tweet notes, these rules have not changed.

""No piece of art has ever emotionally affected me the way this robot arm piece has. It's programmed to try to contain the hydraulic fluid that’s constantly leaking out and required to keep itself running...if too much escapes, it will die so it's desperately trying to pull it back to continue to fight for another day. Saddest part is they gave the robot the ability to do these 'happy dances' to spectators. When the project was first launched it danced around spending most of its time interacting with the crowd since it could quickly pull back the small spillage. Many years later... (as you see it now in the video) it looks tired and hopeless as there isn't enough time to dance anymore.. It now only has enough time to try to keep itself alive as the amount of leaked hydraulic fluid became unmanageable as the spill grew over time. Living its last days in a never-ending cycle between sustaining life and simultaneously bleeding out... (Figuratively and literally as its hydraulic fluid was purposefully made to look like it's actual blood).
""The robot arm finally ran out of hydraulic fluid in 2019, slowly came to a halt and died - And I am now tearing up over a friggin robot arm  It was programmed to live out this fate and no matter what it did or how hard it tried, there was no escaping it.  Spectators watched as it slowly bled out until the day that it ceased to move forever.  Saying that 'this resonates' doesn't even do it justice imo. Created by Sun Yuan & Peng Yu, they named the piece, 'Can't Help Myself'.  What a masterpiece. What a message.""
Extended interpretations: the hydraulic fluid in relation to how we kill ourselves both mentally and physically for money just in an attempt to sustain life, how the system is set up for us to fail on purpose to essentially enslave us and to steal the best years of our lives to play the game that the richest people of the world have designed. How this robs us of our happiness, passion and our inner peace. How we are slowly drowning with more responsibilities, with more expected of us, less rewarding pay-offs and less free time to enjoy ourselves with as the years go by. How there's really no escaping the system and that we were destined at birth to follow a pretty specific path that was already laid out before us. How we can give and give and give and how easily we can be forgotten after we've gone.. How we are loved and respected when we are valuable, then one day we aren't any longer and we become a burden...and how our young, free-caring spirit gets stolen from us as we get churned out of the broken system that we are trapped inside of. Can also be seen to represent the human life cycle and the fact that none of us make it out of this world alive. But also can act as a reminder to allow yourself to heal, rest and love with all of your heart. That the endless chase for 'more' isn't necessary in finding your own inner happiness.”

The liquid is not hydraulic fluid but colored water which was not required to keep the robot from running. The robot did not run out of hydraulic fluid and did not die.

How this robs us of our happiness, passion and our inner peace. How we are slowly drowning with more responsibilities, with more expected of us, less rewarding pay-offs and less free time to enjoy ourselves with as the years go by. How there's really no escaping the system and that we were destined at birth to follow a pretty specific path that was already laid out before us. How we can give and give and give and how easily we can be forgotten after we've gone.. How we are loved and respected when we are valuable, then one day we aren't any longer and we become a burden...and how our young, free-caring spirit gets stolen from us as we get churned out of the broken system that we are trapped inside of. Can also be seen to represent the human life cycle and the fact that none of us make it out of this world alive. But also can act as a reminder to allow yourself to heal, rest and love with all of your heart. That the endless chase for 'more' isn't necessary in finding your own inner happiness.” - James Kricked Parr Read More Articles: https://weirdium.com/donny-osmond-breaks-down-in-tears-during-brother-merrills-final-performance/… Join Now: Kindness, Humanity & Inspiration","The liquid is not hydraulic fluid but colored water which was not required to keep the robot from running.

No one supports abortion up until birth.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The Women’s Health Protection Act prohibits placing restrictions on “abortion at any point or points in time prior to fetal viability” and abortion after fetal viability only when continuing the pregnancy would threaten the patient’s health. (Section 4, Paragraph 8-9)

Maui was attacked by directed energy weapons (dews)

Readers added context they thought people might want to know
This video is unrelated to the 2023 Maui wildfire and any claims of directed-energy weapons ( DEWs).

The video instead shows electrical explosions from failing power lines in Kenner, Louisiana, USA in December 2018:

日本では、このような報道は、あまり見ない。
寧ろ次のようなものだ。
①ウクライナへのロシアの非道な攻撃
②ゼレンスキー氏のそれに対する非難と支援の呼びかけ
③西側研究機関のロシアが如何に弱いかの解説
④反転攻勢するとの結び

日本ではウクライナへのsympathyとロシアへの憎悪がimotionalに報じられる傾向が強いと感じる。

河野太郎がマイナンバーカードの住所照合についてデジタル音痴ぶりを如何なく発揮した件

河野大臣『問題は住所が「港区赤坂一丁目2の3」と書く人もいれば、「港区赤坂1-2-3」と書く人もいる…（中略）将来的にはAIの技術を使って表記揺れを判断することがあり得るかもしれない。』

住所の揺らぎ程度のことを
『将来的にはAIで』

こんなものAI不要。
もちろん使ってもいいが。

河野太郎はこのレベル。

日本の住所正規化は難易度が高くデータベースを手作業で修正するケースは多く長年の課題となっている。これは日本の住所に表記ゆれが非常に多いためであり配送ミスやデータベース修正・維持管理コストなど社会コストの増大に繋がっている。AIで作業が適正化されることは長年の課題の解決に繋がり、大臣の発言は現実に即した内容である。

現在汚染水・処理水は全て福島第一原子力発電所の敷地内に保管しており、安全性に責任を持つ為、負担を増やさない為、敷地外で保管・処理することを望ましくないと考えられています。
そしてタンクは一時保管を目的に設計されている為災害や老朽化で漏れるリスクがあり、「復興・廃炉の両立」に向けて安全性を確保する為にタンク等が支障となる可能性がある為、規制基準値に対してトリチウムは40分の1未満、その他は100分の1未満を満たしたもののみ海洋放出します。

また科学的に安全が保障された処理水を汚染水と呼称することで、風評被害が発生しています。

コミュニティノートは設計がダメ。
・対等な反論手段がない
・元ツイートは発言アカウントが明確だがコミュニティノートの作成アカウントは不明なので不公平
・作成の手間や投票でマジョリティが有利
こういう性質があるので、身元を隠して少数側のツイートを潰したい側に有利な制度設計となっている。

コミュニティノートはTwitter社が作成・選定しているものではありません。
多くのTwitterユーザーからなる協力者が作成・評価し、多様な視点から「役に立つ」評価をされたノートが表示されます。
また、評価アルゴリズムはオープンソースとなっており、誰でも確認することができます。

また、ワクチンを接種した家畜から人間に影響が及ぼされるという証拠はありません

大事な記事です。

最近、ネトウヨと思われる皆さんから、「保険証の不正利用を放置するのか」とのコメントが数多く寄せられています。

もちろん、保険証の不正利用は犯罪（詐欺罪）であり、許されません。

しかし、彼らが、真剣に保険証の不正利用をなくしたいと思っているとは到底思えません。なぜなら、マイナ保険証のほうが“なりすまし”が容易になるからです。

先日、医療事務のスタッフにレクチャーを受け、患者さんがマイナ保険証で受診された場合の動きを確認しました。

患者さんは、本人確認の方法として、“顔認証”か“4桁の暗証番号入力”を選べます。
スタッフは、機会が正常に作動しているかは確認しますが、他の身分証明書を確認することはありません（そもそも、“一体化”が進めば、他の身分証明書はなくなっていきますね）。

つまり、4桁の暗証番号さえ知っていれば、簡単になりすましが可能だということです。

本当に不正利用をなくしたいのから、マイナ保険証には反対のはずですね。

そもそも、この騒ぎは、河野デジタル大臣が「それなりの被害」と言って煽ったことが始まりのようですが、被害の全体像については、厚労省も警察も把握していません。国民健康保険では、年間10件くらい…という話もありますが、かなりのレアケースです。私は25年医者をしていますが、そういう事例に出会ったことはありません。

記事で紹介されているように、現場での不断の努力の成果だと思います。

岸田首相の記者会見。
官邸役人から指名され質問した回数は
最多が産経新聞１３回、次いでＮＨＫの１２回。
最も少ないのは、東京新聞とＴＢＳの４回。
だが、そもそも致命的なのは
指名権を官邸に渡し、自由な質問を封じられ
国家権力に仕切られた内閣記者会のていたらくだ。

「金返せ」「何のための値上げ」電力9社の10兆円黒字にネットブチ切れ…過去最高益の会社も

電気代を大幅値下げしろ。

既に取り返しのつかないことをしたお前たちのせめてもの罪滅ぼしだ。

 that Dr. Anthony Fauci has been in charge of developing bioweapons for the Pentagon since 2002, and in 2014, three viruses escaped from US labs, so he moved his bioweapons research to the Wuhan lab:

""They took the money that Cheney gave them [from the Patriot Act], $2.2 billion, and they funneled it through NIH, and it all went through Anthony Fauci. So beginning in 2002, Anthony Fauci got a 68% raise from the Pentagon for doing bioweapons development, and he got a raise of billions of dollars a year, and then he started doing all of this gain-of-function.

In 2014, three of those bugs escaped in high-profile escapes from different labs in the US. Congress held hearings on it. Everybody was angry, and 300 top scientists sent letters to Obama saying you got to shut down Fauci because he is going to create a pandemic.

So, Obama ordered a moratorium, and at that time, Fauci had eighteen different gain-of-function experiments he was doing around the US. He instead moved his stuff offshore to Wuhan, where he could do it out of sight of these 300 scientists and nosy White House officials who were trying to shut him down.

And he continued to do it with the same people he was funding here, Ralph Baric and Peter Dazak, and they moved their operation to the Wuhan lab.""

In 2014, three of those bugs escaped in high-profile escapes from different labs in the US. Congress held hearings on it. Everybody was angry, and 300 top scientists sent letters to Obama saying you got to shut down Fauci because he is going to create a pandemic.  So, Obama ordered a moratorium, and at that time, Fauci had eighteen different gain-of-function experiments he was doing around the US. He instead moved his stuff offshore to Wuhan, where he could do it out of sight of these 300 scientists and nosy White House officials who were trying to shut him down.  And he continued to do it with the same people he was funding here, Ralph Baric and Peter Dazak, and they moved their operation to the Wuhan lab.""",,"6:30 PM · Mar 13, 2023","·

A constitutional republic is a form of  representative government. A representative democracy is a form of representative government. So it is correct to call the  United States a democracy. Not a direct democracy to be sure, but a democracy nonetheless

These numbers come from different surveys and cannot be compared in this way.

A fair comparison shows that both survey results show approximately the same increase in employment.

The facts don’t fit the Establishment’s narrative, and neither does the law. Jack Smith’s prosecution of President Trump is likely unlawful under the Presidential Records Act. Directly from the 2012 federal court decision on the Clinton Sock Drawer case relating to classified documents:

“The decision to segregate personal materials from Presidential records is made by the President, during the President’s term and in his sole discretion.”

“The [Act] does not confer any mandatory or even discretional authority on the archivist… Under the statute, this responsibility is left solely to the President.”

This is hard judicial precedent, these are the hard facts.

Tucker doesn’t seem to care about the letter considering he is ramping up his series and plans to drop a new episode on Tuesday responding to the Trump indictment.

Joe Biden is the only person who can exonerate himself from bribery allegations.

He hasn’t shown transparency.

In fact, he’s mocked the question when it was brought up.

His henchmen at the DOJ and FBI are stonewalling the Senate and the American people.

There is no “conspiracy” in

(1) the vaccine being rushed

(2) there being serious adverse effects

(3) the efficacy being weak and waning at best 

(4) the vaccine not having been tested on all cause mortality

(5) serious statistical worries that the efficacy has been overestimated due to systematic biases, like counting acquisition of Covid within three weeks of being vaxxed as “unvaccinated”

(6) the risks of Covid for anyone healthy being negligible, so why take the vax?

(7) that much of the population already had superior natural immunity prior to the existence of the vax

(8) that the state engaged in centralized censorship of voices skeptical of vaccine efficacy, need and all cause mortality 

(9) that most who took the vax did so without informed consent, because they were not informed of the benefits and risks (see also censorship), and they were threatened with losing their job and being unable to participate in society if they didn’t take it

(10) that the unvaccinated were treated as less than human, and it was justifiable to do anything to them, from banishment to quarantine to denial of healthcare.

Maybe these ten reasons are why people are skeptical of vaccines, and free, honest and open discussion, along with informed consent, would be preferable.

We recently studied social media & COVID vaccine hesitancy.

Joe Rogan's Twitter followers were extremely distrustful of vaccines: only 27% of his followers planned to get vaccinated.

The good news is that Ukraine caught their highest judge hiding some of his more than $2 million in bribes in pickle jars. The bad news is that Ukraine, consistently ranked as one of the most corrupt nations on the planet, still has high-ranking officials robbing it blind.

This might be a salient point when Ukraine returns to Congress to beg for more US taxpayer funds. Why won’t Democrats accept my call for a Special Inspector General to oversee the billions we send to Ukraine?

Tesla driver monitoring is another scam from Master Scammer Musk.
@Tesla
 Full Self-Driving is intended to be used without hands on the wheel, as shown by Elon Musk on 60 Minutes,  in the Tesla “Paint it Black” marketing video, and almost every FSD drive video on YouTube! https://twitter.com/TheTeslaBull/status/1677608792559583234…

Our Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a critical part of our national security. It is absolutely inexplicable that we'd sell some of that crude oil to the Chinese Communist Party or any company under its control. I’m proud to lead the bipartisan effort to stop this from ever happening in the future.

Tesla faked its dashboard range projections under orders from Elon Musk so it seemed drivers could go farther before recharging. Last year, the volume of complaints became so high it created a special team to start canceling owners’ service appointments.

Tesla’s secret team to suppress thousands of driving range complaints
About a decade ago, Tesla rigged the dashboard readouts in its electric cars to provide “rosy” projections of how far owners can drive before needing to recharge, a source told Reuters.

Apparently it is now a crime to make statements challenging election results if a prosecutor decides those statements aren’t true. 

So when should we expect indictments of the democrat politicians  who falsely claimed Russia hacked the 2016 election?
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
This week’s criminal indictments of former President Trump explicitly state that it is not a crime to challenge elections or to make false statements about them.

The indictments allege Trump and co-conspirators took actions to commit fraud and impede government functions.

I wrote about Amy Coney Barrett's blithe suggestion that no one needs abortion because women who don't want to be mothers can just give their kids up for adoption and why, as an adoptee, I find that argument abhorrent: https://nytimes.com/2021/12/03/opinion/adoption-supreme-court-amy-coney-barrett.html…

When Biden responded to Trump in the debate that 5 former heads of the CIA and 51 former intelligence officials believed the Hunter Biden story was a Russian plant, it was an impressive talking point, because who could imagine that all those people would lie? Well now we know the answer to that question. If the security state won’t stop lying and interfering in American elections, perhaps it’s time to do what President John F Kennedy wanted — dismantle the whole thing and start over.

Democrat AG Merrick Garland is arresting Democrat's political opponents - and still the Republican Party is too chicken shit to impeach him.

Christopher Wray is interfering in our elections and running the FBI as the secret police for the Democrat party - and still the Republican Party is too chicken shit to impeach him.

Joe Biden has taken bribes and extorted money from enemy countries (treason) - and still the Republican Party is too chicken shit to impeach him.

The Republican Party = useless, spineless, worthless, good-for-nothing cowards.

Jake Tapper is a Democrat who worked for a Democrat congresswoman and Handgun Control Inc.  He's a partisan hack, like all the rest of the frauds on CNN.  Hence, he sees ""no evidence"" Biden did anything wrong.  Of course, he sees overwhelming evidence that Trump should be behind bars until he dies.  Tapper is a propagandist in the best tradition of Vladmir Putin's state-run media hosts.  https://breitbart.com/clips/2023/08/10/cnns-tapper-to-comer-certainly-theres-sleaze-but-no-evidence-that-president-biden-did-anything-illegal/…

: All price increases are the result of war and sanctions, but we have seen, and everyone has seen, the conditions in the shops and our supermarkets and the malls, and we have seen that the level of price increases is higher than would otherwise be justified by the economic situation. I call this unjustified price gauging and price speculation. Multinational corporations have been at the forefront of this. And we had to show strength, we had to say that this is unacceptable.

SHOCKING:  the Burisma accountant who was a cooperating witness set to testify in the Biden bribery scheme has been found dead.  

The woman, who was the wife of former executive Mykola Lisin, was found dead before she had a chance to testify.   Her Husband also died in 2011 in a mysterious car accident when Biden was VP.  Their son was also beaten and kidnapped in Kyiv, Ukraine.  Also, even though Lisin was an MP in Ukraine and prominent businessman, his entire history has been almost completely scrubbed from the internet. 

It’s starting to appear as if Biden will once again get away with it thanks to mysterious deaths and assistance from the FBI in hiding the details of the case.

This video that shows Bill Gates walking out of an interview with Sarah Ferguson is a deepfake! 

The real interview took place on January 30, 2023 and has nothing to do with what is shown in the manipulated video. Here is the link to the article that explains everything:

NATO will change the status of the air force mission for the protection of the skies of the Baltic states to combat, Stoltenberg said. Previously, there was the status of the air police.

The so-called air police control the space above the Baltic states and are not considered a military mission. And with a combat mandate, NATO fighters will be able to participate in hostilities and be integrated into Lithuania's defense plans.

In addition, the German Defense Minister said that his country intends to deploy an additional 4,000 troops in Lithuania on a long-term basis.

BREAKING:  The Democrat Attorney General in Michigan didn’t reveal that her office had a team investigating a widespread voter fraud operation, even though she’s claimed many times that no widespread voter fraud existed in 2020.  

In 2020 a woman dropped off thousands of ballots to a county clerks office and the signatures were all similar and the addresses on a lot of them weren’t real.  What the investigation uncovered was massive.  A company being paid by democrats running operations in multiple states! 

The State Police found thousands of empty ballots, pre paid cards, money, and even weapons.  The woman claims she was being paid $1150/week to collect ballots from people.   

This is huge and the evidence showing a massive voter fraud operation is undeniable at this point.  The 2020 election should’ve never been certified!  Trump is innocent!

SHOCKING: New Study proves Pfizer mRNA induced turbo cancer

In a new Belgian study by Sander Eens et al. they injected 14 mice with 2 Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.

2 days after 2nd Pfizer dose, 1/14 mice (7%) died suddenly, had turbo cancer with lymphoma infiltration of many organs: liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs & intestines.

The turbo cancer mouse had shown no clinical signs of illness before sudden death.

This is the 2nd study to show turbo cancer after Pfizer mRNA vaccination. 

These were the types of studies that Pfizer & Moderna should have performed on mice but never did.

Key point: This 14 mouse study was larger than the study done to approve COVID-19 Omicron bivalent mRNA booster shots which were given to 100s of millions of people - that study only had 8 mice.

The study itself says it did not find evidence proving or refuting the link with cancer.
The single mouse that got cancer was already losing weight *before* getting vaccinated.  The other mice didn't lose weight.

The Taliban, Iranian dictators, Chinese leaders putting religious minorities in concentration camps, all of these people can have Twitter accounts, but not Alex Berenson, a reporter covering covid policy, or Donald Trump, the democratically elected president of the US. Insanity.

We left behind $85 billion of military equipment to terrorists who chant “Death to America”.

Ghislaine Maxwell likely ran one of the most powerful Reddit accounts in history.

It was the:
- 8th highest ranking account in total karma
- 1st account to reach 1M karma
- Power mod for the site's largest subreddits

She posted almost daily until she was taken into custody.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
There’s no evidence for this and reddit’s admins have said it isn’t true and that the real owner of the account is being harassed due to this unfounded conspiracy theory.

Why is there no party in America called the Independent Party?  In many states you are not allowed to name a party ‘Independent,’ likely because the duopoly knows that anyone on that line would get a ton of votes.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
There are in fact parties named 'the Independent party' in multiple states (which may be the reason it's not possible to give another the same name in those states.) They do not in fact 'get a ton of votes.'

Reuters fact checked it and they believe in science. Lockdowns worked.

They even called out some anti-science “lockdown skeptics.”

Countless suicides, overdoses, and bankruptcies later, a study by John Hopkins Univ. says lockdowns destroyed lives instead of saving them.

There is no evidence that this has occurred. Foreign policy experts at the White House and elsewhere have said that this claim by Russia indicates that Russia may soon begin chemical weapons attacks and then claim that they are false flag attacks perpetrated by Ukrainians. bbc.com/news/uk-606832…

Nobody will or should prohibit a procedure to save a woman experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. You can nut-pick a speech by a state Rep. somewhere, but all pro-life activists, and centuries of Catholic teaching make a distinction on exactly this sort of circumstance.

Louisiana is voting on a bill to criminalize IUDs, and plans on charging women with murder for using them.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The bill is not designed to ban IUDs, but that may be a side-effect based on an interpretation by the bill’s opponents.
