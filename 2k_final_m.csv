The CDC has been lying to people for over 20 years in denying the link between vaccines and autism. In just 40 minutes after launching my survey, I now have a highly statistically significant result. 

If you are unvaccinated vs. 10 or more vaccines, you have a 6X lower chance of being diagnosed with autism. The result is highly statistically significant (p=.0023). I'll make the data public tomorrow (Andy Wakefield and others already have it). 

Nobody should be surprised. The Mawson study and Hooker study (both published in peer-reviewed journals and not retracted) both showed very similar values (4X and 5X respectively).

All the data is verifiable. My study is larger and more diverse than theirs.

Any mainstream media ""fact checker"" want to check the facts? The whole thing was done in full public view.

The CDC had 20 years to run the same survey I did. It only took me about 2 hours to write and debug it. I'll publicly release the data tomorrow for everyone to analyze. Maybe the CDC can make the signal go away through clever subgroup analysis.

Tree planting in NYC is at an unacceptable low and we need Parks to kick into high gear. 

Experts agree improving our tree canopy is one of the best ways we can fight climate change. We must fully fund Parks operations and pick up the pace today!

‘KAREN’ STOLE MY BIKE?

A video’s gone viral of what appears to be a woman in New York trying to steal a pre-paid Citi Bike - and then playing the victim. It’s been flagged by prominent Black civil-rights defenders as another case of a White woman playing the race card in a sinister way, as she seems to make out that she’s being threatened - by the person who’d paid for the bike and his friends, a group of Black men. It’s re-ignited online discussion of so-called ‘Karens’ - a pejorative term that’s gained currency to refer to self-entitled White women, including those who exploit White privilege or racial stereotyping. A prominent case was a few years back in New York’s Central Park, when a woman was filmed crying out for help, claiming that an African-American man was trying to attack her, when in fact he’d just asked her to put her dog back on the lead.

IDK how to forgive & move on from the fact that Democrats in power when I was born didn’t use their power fully — refused to codify Roe, refused to pass court reform, refused to codify gay marriage, refused to believe that Republicans would go this far (delusional bc it’s so obvious), etc. — each & all of whom are hugely responsible for the mess we are in today — but have left us this disgraceful legacy to clean up.

The term “swatting” refers to the practice of making an intentionally false report to police in order to elicit a forceful and potentially violent police response.

Start with a mandatory natl. gun and ammo registry. Guns must be visibly marked with their serial numbers so they are visible even when holstered.

Then ban new weapons that aren't biocoded for safety reasons.

According to a 2021 APA survey, 42% of Americans gained un-desired weight during the lockdowns, with the average weight gain of those individuals being 29lbs.

@RobertKennedyJr
Since the assassination of my father in 1968, candidates for president are provided Secret Service protection.  But not me.
 
Typical turnaround time for pro forma protection requests from presidential candidates is 14-days.  After 88-days of no response and after several follow-ups by our campaign, the Biden Administration just denied our request.  Secretary Mayorkas: ""I have determined that Secret Service protection for Robert F Kennedy Jr is not warranted at this time.""
 Our campaign's request included a 67-page report from the world's leading protection firm, detailing unique and well established security and safety risks aside from commonplace death threats.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The Secret Service does not provide protection to non-incumbent Presidential candidates until 120 days before the general election.

The next election is Nov. 5, 2024.
July 8, 2024 is 120 days prior.

A 9,000-year-old skeleton was discovered inside a cave in Cheddar, England, and was affectionately dubbed ""Cheddar Man."" DNA testing confirmed that a living relative lived approximately half a mile away, tracing their lineage back nearly 300 generations.

In 1903, while conducting excavations in Cheddar Gorge, Somerset, UK, researchers stumbled upon a remarkable find: the skeletal remains of a Homo sapien who had lived around 9,000 years ago. This individual ranks among the oldest modern humans ever found in Britain. The discovery occurred serendipitously during a drainage renovation within the tourist attraction of Gough's Cave.

Cheddar Man thrived during the Mesolithic period roughly 9,000 years ago. Most likely, he was a hunter-gatherer who passed away in his twenties and stood at a height of approximately 5 feet, 5 inches.

The use of cutting-edge technology has enabled researchers to reconstruct Cheddar Man's facial features, determine his skin and eye coloring, and even discern the texture of his hair. Genetic material extracted from one of Cheddar Man's molar teeth allowed scientists to identify Adrian Targett, a retired history teacher, as a relative.

Upon analysis, it was revealed that Targett's family lineage had endured in the Cheddar Gorge region for approximately nine millennia, with genes passed from mother to daughter through mitochondrial DNA, inherited from the egg.

In simple terms, Adrian Targett and Cheddar Man share a common maternal ancestor.

Again, the Manhattan DA is charging a man who defended himself with attempted murder.

Remember, if someone shoots you, you have to just take it. You cannot defend yourself in any way, and you certainly cannot disarm your assailant after being shot and use his weapon against him.

Progressives want you completely defenseless and at the mercy of murderers, fearing for your life and fearing for your freedom should you try to protect yourself.

24 nations signed the Montreal Protocol limiting the use of CFCs in 1987. Scientists estimate that if the Montreal Protocol had never been implemented, the hole would have grown by 40 percent by 2013. Instead, the hole is expected to completely heal by 2050.

Y’all know that vaccine ain’t approved by the FDA right?
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
This is misleading. The COVID-19 vaccines are fully authorized by FDA scientists, and recommended by the CDC.

The term ""FDA approved"" has a technical legal meaning. The vaccines aren't ""FDA approved"" yet, but that's only because they went through a different legal process.

To the gentle lady from Colorado, as someone who was incapable of getting into college yourself, you’re neither qualified nor competent to comment on the topic of student loans for college. 

And since you brought up the topic of taxpayers paying for loans, let’s discuss how your buddy Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene had $183,504 in PPP loans forgiven.

This was all money from taxpayers that wasn’t paid back. 

Why is it ok for her, but not for poor people trying to better themselves through education? 

Finally, you call this a victory for personal responsibility…

Maybe someone who just became a grandma at 36 shouldn’t be lecturing the rest of us about personal responsibility.

JUST IN: The Biden Department of 'Justice' is suing Elon Musk's SpaceX for refusing to hire refugees and asylum seekers.

Musk should change his name to Hunter Biden and coerce foreign entities to get rich so the DOJ ignores him.

“The lawsuit alleges that, from at least September 2018 to May 2022, SpaceX routinely discouraged asylees and refugees from applying and refused to hire or consider them, because of their citizenship status, in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act,” the Justice Department said.

“Our investigation found that SpaceX failed to fairly consider or hire asylees and refugees because of their citizenship status and imposed what amounted to a ban on their hire regardless of their qualification, in violation of federal law,” US Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said.

There is a lot of confusion in the responses to this tweet as to whether or not this is a doctored/deepfake video. 

This is in fact unedited legitimate footage from a Joe Biden speech which took place on 2/28/23.

The politically-motivated Left failed miserably in their attempt to destroy me. They’re now trying to falsely discredit me by saying I admitted I lied.

That is FALSE. I would NEVER lie. Lying requires INTENTIONALLY making a false statement.

I never did that, nor did I stipulate to or admit that.

As has become sadly typical, the opposition-controlled media is intentionally twisting the truth, conflating the full RPC standard with the actual stipulation. The standard reads, “dishonesty, fraud, deceit, OR misrepresentation.”

The Colorado bar counsel and my counsel concluded that it was best to resolve the bar complaints by agreeing to a public censure.

Bar complaints have been filed all over the country by people Trump lawyers have never met, had no client relationship with, and who are totally partisan against Trump. This is and always was political lawfare to intimidate lawyers from representing Trump or Republicans candidates, especially in election challenges and try to destroy our livelihood and reputation. Organizations filing complaints have been open about this motivation.

I am grateful to have this behind me, thankful to the Colorado OARC and the PDJ for treating me fairly in spite of immense political pressure and to my lawyers who have stood by me and given me wise counsel, and I remain in good standing and fully licensed in the State of Colorado.

I’ll continue speaking truth to the best of my ability and zealously advocating for due process, having learned I can do so in media even more carefully, while NEVER backing down to the political opposition mob who would seek to destroy me, my vocation, my mission, and my voice.

BREAKING: Shocking scandal rocks MAGA world as authorities arrest Fabian Marta — the man who funded the QAnon child trafficking movie ""Sound of Freedom"" that has been the toast of Republican circles for weeks now — for one of the worst crimes imaginable.

You won't believe this one...

Conservatives have been obsessed with Sound of Freedom, a movie that tells the lie-riddled but supposedly true story of a man chasing down pedophiles and international child traffickers. 

The movie has struck a cord with deranged conservatives who believe that Democrats are all blood-drinking Satanic child molesters and has racked in $155 million so far. 

Prominent Republicans and Fox News have praised the awful film for ""spreading awareness"" about child trafficking despite it being chock-full of fabrications.

The film was at least partially funded by a man named Fabian Marta. He bragged that he helped get the movie financed and made after Disney refused to release it.

Now, Marta has been outed as one of the villains from his own movie. According to the Missouri Courts website, he was arrested on July 21 for felony child kidnapping. He has also been accused of hosting predatory ""sugar baby"" events.

While the full details of Marta's child kidnapping case have yet to emerge, it certainly seems that his role in getting Sound of Freedom made was an act of profound psychological projection.

Isn't that always the case with Republicans? They accuse of others of doing what they themselves are guilty of.

This man must be locked up. Children are at risk.

Please retweet and  if you believe Marta belongs in prison — and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a “woke” new Twitter competitor that banned Trump for life and is exploding in popularity because Elon Musk banned Tribel’s Twitter account — but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: http://tribel.app.link/okwPIHYCIqb

People died or were severely injured because of bad science.  It didn't have to be that way.
For those of us physicians and scientists who were metaphorically ""burned at the stake"" for stating these facts years ago, there is no justice.  Heck, most of us are still completely banned (linked in) or shadow banned on most social media platforms. We will never get our careers back. The damage done is significant. 
But people died from remdesivir.  Never forget that the government did that.  It was all about regulatory capture.

CEO of Anheuser-Busch has now blamed social media users for “misinformation and disinformation” after the beer brand lost $6 billion in stock value. 

CEO Michael Doukeris claimed that the Dylan Mulvaney campaign “was not an advertisement” - despite the fact Dylan’s instagram listed it as a paid partnership. 

He said of the social media boycott campaign: 

“You have one fact and every person puts an opinion behind the fact. And then the opinions start to be replicated fast on each and every comment. By the time that 10 or 20 people put a comment out there, the reality is no longer what the fact is, but is more (about) what the comments were.” 

Anheuser-Busch stocks came crashing down after Dylan Mulvaney posted the paid partnership to his instagram. The brand has lost 26.1% of value vs the same period last year.

Ukrainian President Zelensky, who met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Saturday, broke most of the rules of etiquette. In particular, he did not miss the pontiff at the entrance to his office.
 “When Zelensky arrived at the Vatican, after greeting the Pope, both went to the pontiff’s office. However, Zelensky will not let the pontiff go ahead, but squeezed into the office right in front of him, ” writes Exxpress.
The publication indicates that Zelensky sat in a chair, although the Pope was still standing. He, sitting, accepted a handshake from one of the advisers to the pontiff.
 At the meeting, the Kiev leader took the liberty of correcting Francis' speech.

これらの予防接種は、母から乳児が受け継いだ免疫が落ちる時期、病気のかかりやすさや重症化しやすい年齢などに応じて適切な時期、回数が指定されています(※2)

母子手帳は接種時期、接種状況の記録に役立ちます。活用して忘れずに接種しましょう。

岸田首相の会見の最後で声を上げ、核軍縮ビジョンについて最前列から問いました。岸田氏は事前に決まっていた4社の質問に答えただけだったので、「事前に決まっていた4社以外にも答えて欲しい。核軍縮ビジョンについて質問させて下さい」と訴えましたが、それでも答えてくれず、「逃げるんですか」とさらに問いました。すると、岸田氏は戻ってきて回答。ただ、首相は核軍縮ビジョンについて、自分の宣伝したい見解を強調しただけでした。私はさらに「核を認める宣言がここで出てしまった、この広島でそんな宣言を出したのは大きな間違いだったのではないか」と問いましたが、首相はそのまま立ち去りました。

今回の核軍縮ビジョンには、米中露英仏の核5大国が昨年1月に出した「核兵器の防衛目的の役割、侵略の抑止、戦争の防止」の効果、をうたった声明と全く同じ英語の文言が盛り込まれ、核軍縮とは名ばかりで、実質は米国主導の核兵器容認声明になっています。

核廃絶のシンボルである広島で、核の抑止力や役割をうたった5大国の昨年1月の声明内容や論理がそのまま盛り込まれたのは、歴史に残る事態です。その点を、首相にきちんと質したかったのですが、首相は私の声かけには戻ってきたものの、マイクできちんと質問させてもらえず、首相は核軍縮ビジョンについての一方的な見解述べただけで終わってしまい、非常に残念でした。

官邸が事前にシナリオを決め、それを日本のプレスも外国プレスも容認しているのはあまりにもおかしいと思います。WHでの大統領会見などG7の首脳会見に私は何度も出てきましたが、日本の首相記者会見は、G7で最低だと感じます。

 Bookmarks",Toshi Ogata (尾形　聡彦）,@ToshihikoOgata,岸田首相の会見の最後で声を上げ、核軍縮ビジョンについて最前列から問いました。岸田氏は事前に決まっていた4社の質問に答えただけだったので、「事前に決まっていた4社以外にも答えて欲しい。核軍縮ビジョンについて質問させて下さい」と訴えましたが、それでも答えてくれず、「逃げるんですか」とさらに問いました。すると、岸田氏は戻ってきて回答。ただ、首相は核軍縮ビジョンについて、自分の宣伝したい見解を強調しただけでした。私はさらに「核を認める宣言がここで出てしまった、この広島でそんな宣言を出したのは大きな間違いだったのではないか」と問いましたが、首相はそのまま立ち去りました。  今回の核軍縮ビジョンには、米中露英仏の核5大国が昨年1月に出した「核兵器の防衛目的の役割、侵略の抑止、戦争の防止」の効果、をうたった声明と全く同じ英語の文言が盛り込まれ、核軍縮とは名ばかりで、実質は米国主導の核兵器容認声明になっています。  核廃絶のシンボルである広島で、核の抑止力や役割をうたった5大国の昨年1月の声明内容や論理がそのまま盛り込まれたのは、歴史に残る事態です。その点を、首相にきちんと質したかったのですが、首相は私の声かけには戻ってきたものの、マイクできちんと質問させてもらえず、首相は核軍縮ビジョンについての一方的な見解述べただけで終わってしまい、非常に残念でした。  官邸が事前にシナリオを決め、それを日本のプレスも外国プレスも容認しているのはあまりにもおかしいと思います。WHでの大統領会見などG7の首脳会見に私は何度も出てきましたが、日本の首相記者会見は、G7で最低だと感じます。  https://youtube.com/live/xfeVCc5Ludo?feature=share… Translate post,"""政府側は、今回の議長国会見を30分間の予定で実施するとしていた。最初に首相が会見を終えようとした際、開始から約40分が経過していた。"" これがすべてだと思います mainichi.jp/articles/20230… Context is written by people who use X, and appears when rated helpful by others.

原発処理水の放出にお墨付き…IAEAは本当に「中立」か 日本は巨額の分担金、電力業界も人員派遣

IAEAはどこまで信を置けるのか。かねて日本政府は、IAEAに巨額の分担金や拠出金を支出してきた。IAEAのお墨付きは、中立的な立場から出たと受け止めるべきか？

https://tokyo-np.co.jp/article/261656

国際機関には加盟国の義務的拠出金があり、経済規模に基づくためアメリカ、中国に次ぐ第3位です（2020年）。2021年に派遣された日本人の職員数は41人、全職員2550人のうちの1.6％に過ぎません。幹部以上は1人のみ。

""No piece of art has ever emotionally affected me the way this robot arm piece has. It's programmed to try to contain the hydraulic fluid that’s constantly leaking out and required to keep itself running...if too much escapes, it will die so it's desperately trying to pull it back to continue to fight for another day. Saddest part is they gave the robot the ability to do these 'happy dances' to spectators. When the project was first launched it danced around spending most of its time interacting with the crowd since it could quickly pull back the small spillage. Many years later... (as you see it now in the video) it looks tired and hopeless as there isn't enough time to dance anymore.. It now only has enough time to try to keep itself alive as the amount of leaked hydraulic fluid became unmanageable as the spill grew over time. Living its last days in a never-ending cycle between sustaining life and simultaneously bleeding out... (Figuratively and literally as its hydraulic fluid was purposefully made to look like it's actual blood).
""The robot arm finally ran out of hydraulic fluid in 2019, slowly came to a halt and died - And I am now tearing up over a friggin robot arm  It was programmed to live out this fate and no matter what it did or how hard it tried, there was no escaping it.  Spectators watched as it slowly bled out until the day that it ceased to move forever.  Saying that 'this resonates' doesn't even do it justice imo. Created by Sun Yuan & Peng Yu, they named the piece, 'Can't Help Myself'.  What a masterpiece. What a message.""
Extended interpretations: the hydraulic fluid in relation to how we kill ourselves both mentally and physically for money just in an attempt to sustain life, how the system is set up for us to fail on purpose to essentially enslave us and to steal the best years of our lives to play the game that the richest people of the world have designed. How this robs us of our happiness, passion and our inner peace. How we are slowly drowning with more responsibilities, with more expected of us, less rewarding pay-offs and less free time to enjoy ourselves with as the years go by. How there's really no escaping the system and that we were destined at birth to follow a pretty specific path that was already laid out before us. How we can give and give and give and how easily we can be forgotten after we've gone.. How we are loved and respected when we are valuable, then one day we aren't any longer and we become a burden...and how our young, free-caring spirit gets stolen from us as we get churned out of the broken system that we are trapped inside of. Can also be seen to represent the human life cycle and the fact that none of us make it out of this world alive. But also can act as a reminder to allow yourself to heal, rest and love with all of your heart. That the endless chase for 'more' isn't necessary in finding your own inner happiness.”

Created by Sun Yuan & Peng Yu, they named the piece, 'Can't Help Myself'.  What a masterpiece. What a message."" Extended interpretations: the hydraulic fluid in relation to how we kill ourselves both mentally and physically for money just in an attempt to sustain life, how the system is set up for us to fail on purpose to essentially enslave us and to steal the best years of our lives to play the game that the richest people of the world have designed. How this robs us of our happiness, passion and our inner peace. How we are slowly drowning with more responsibilities, with more expected of us, less rewarding pay-offs and less free time to enjoy ourselves with as the years go by. How there's really no escaping the system and that we were destined at birth to follow a pretty specific path that was already laid out before us. How we can give and give and give and how easily we can be forgotten after we've gone.. How we are loved and respected when we are valuable, then one day we aren't any longer and we become a burden...and how our young, free-caring spirit gets stolen from us as we get churned out of the broken system that we are trapped inside of. Can also be seen to represent the human life cycle and the fact that none of us make it out of this world alive. But also can act as a reminder to allow yourself to heal, rest and love with all of your heart. That the endless chase for 'more' isn't necessary in finding your own inner happiness.” - James Kricked Parr Read More Articles: https://weirdium.com/donny-osmond-breaks-down-in-tears-during-brother-merrills-final-performance/… Join Now: Kindness, Humanity & Inspiration","The liquid is not hydraulic fluid but colored water which was not required to keep the robot from running.

①ウクライナへのロシアの非道な攻撃
②ゼレンスキー氏のそれに対する非難と支援の呼びかけ
③西側研究機関のロシアが如何に弱いかの解説
④反転攻勢するとの結び

日本ではウクライナへのsympathyとロシアへの憎悪がimotionalに報じられる傾向が強いと感じる。

総指揮官が毎回、テレビの前で世界に向かって語りかける。
情報戦も戦争の一つだが、こうも続くと違和感を禁じえないひとたちが出てきて、いわゆる援助疲れも広がっている。

河野太郎がマイナンバーカードの住所照合についてデジタル音痴ぶりを如何なく発揮した件

河野大臣『問題は住所が「港区赤坂一丁目2の3」と書く人もいれば、「港区赤坂1-2-3」と書く人もいる…（中略）将来的にはAIの技術を使って表記揺れを判断することがあり得るかもしれない。』

住所の揺らぎ程度のことを
『将来的にはAIで』

こんなものAI不要。
もちろん使ってもいいが。

河野太郎はこのレベル。
頭が10年遅れてる。

日本の住所正規化は難易度が高くデータベースを手作業で修正するケースは多く長年の課題となっている。これは日本の住所に表記ゆれが非常に多いためであり配送ミスやデータベース修正・維持管理コストなど社会コストの増大に繋がっている。AIで作業が適正化されることは長年の課題の解決に繋がり、大臣の発言は現実に即した内容である。

現在汚染水・処理水は全て福島第一原子力発電所の敷地内に保管しており、安全性に責任を持つ為、負担を増やさない為、敷地外で保管・処理することを望ましくないと考えられています。
そしてタンクは一時保管を目的に設計されている為災害や老朽化で漏れるリスクがあり、「復興・廃炉の両立」に向けて安全性を確保する為にタンク等が支障となる可能性がある為、規制基準値に対してトリチウムは40分の1未満、その他は100分の1未満を満たしたもののみ海洋放出します。

また科学的に安全が保障された処理水を汚染水と呼称することで、風評被害が発生しています。

多くのTwitterユーザーからなる協力者が作成・評価し、多様な視点から「役に立つ」評価をされたノートが表示されます。
また、評価アルゴリズムはオープンソースとなっており、誰でも確認することができます。

実際には家畜に対するmRNAワクチンの接種や市場への流通も行われていません。将来的な利用を見越した家畜に対するmRNAワクチンの研究が行われるという情報から派生した誤った情報です

また、ワクチンを接種した家畜から人間に影響が及ぼされるという証拠はありません

大事な記事です。

最近、ネトウヨと思われる皆さんから、「保険証の不正利用を放置するのか」とのコメントが数多く寄せられています。

もちろん、保険証の不正利用は犯罪（詐欺罪）であり、許されません。

しかし、彼らが、真剣に保険証の不正利用をなくしたいと思っているとは到底思えません。なぜなら、マイナ保険証のほうが“なりすまし”が容易になるからです。

先日、医療事務のスタッフにレクチャーを受け、患者さんがマイナ保険証で受診された場合の動きを確認しました。

患者さんは、本人確認の方法として、“顔認証”か“4桁の暗証番号入力”を選べます。
スタッフは、機会が正常に作動しているかは確認しますが、他の身分証明書を確認することはありません（そもそも、“一体化”が進めば、他の身分証明書はなくなっていきますね）。

つまり、4桁の暗証番号さえ知っていれば、簡単になりすましが可能だということです。

本当に不正利用をなくしたいのから、マイナ保険証には反対のはずですね。

そもそも、この騒ぎは、河野デジタル大臣が「それなりの被害」と言って煽ったことが始まりのようですが、被害の全体像については、厚労省も警察も把握していません。国民健康保険では、年間10件くらい…という話もありますが、かなりのレアケースです。私は25年医者をしていますが、そういう事例に出会ったことはありません。

記事で紹介されているように、現場での不断の努力の成果だと思います。

 that Dr. Anthony Fauci has been in charge of developing bioweapons for the Pentagon since 2002, and in 2014, three viruses escaped from US labs, so he moved his bioweapons research to the Wuhan lab:

""They took the money that Cheney gave them [from the Patriot Act], $2.2 billion, and they funneled it through NIH, and it all went through Anthony Fauci. So beginning in 2002, Anthony Fauci got a 68% raise from the Pentagon for doing bioweapons development, and he got a raise of billions of dollars a year, and then he started doing all of this gain-of-function.

In 2014, three of those bugs escaped in high-profile escapes from different labs in the US. Congress held hearings on it. Everybody was angry, and 300 top scientists sent letters to Obama saying you got to shut down Fauci because he is going to create a pandemic.

So, Obama ordered a moratorium, and at that time, Fauci had eighteen different gain-of-function experiments he was doing around the US. He instead moved his stuff offshore to Wuhan, where he could do it out of sight of these 300 scientists and nosy White House officials who were trying to shut him down.

And he continued to do it with the same people he was funding here, Ralph Baric and Peter Dazak, and they moved their operation to the Wuhan lab.""

The facts don’t fit the Establishment’s narrative, and neither does the law. Jack Smith’s prosecution of President Trump is likely unlawful under the Presidential Records Act. Directly from the 2012 federal court decision on the Clinton Sock Drawer case relating to classified documents:

“The decision to segregate personal materials from Presidential records is made by the President, during the President’s term and in his sole discretion.”

“The [Act] does not confer any mandatory or even discretional authority on the archivist… Under the statute, this responsibility is left solely to the President.”

This is hard judicial precedent, these are the hard facts.

There is no “conspiracy” in

(1) the vaccine being rushed

(2) there being serious adverse effects

(3) the efficacy being weak and waning at best 

(4) the vaccine not having been tested on all cause mortality

(5) serious statistical worries that the efficacy has been overestimated due to systematic biases, like counting acquisition of Covid within three weeks of being vaxxed as “unvaccinated”

(6) the risks of Covid for anyone healthy being negligible, so why take the vax?

(7) that much of the population already had superior natural immunity prior to the existence of the vax

(8) that the state engaged in centralized censorship of voices skeptical of vaccine efficacy, need and all cause mortality 

(9) that most who took the vax did so without informed consent, because they were not informed of the benefits and risks (see also censorship), and they were threatened with losing their job and being unable to participate in society if they didn’t take it

(10) that the unvaccinated were treated as less than human, and it was justifiable to do anything to them, from banishment to quarantine to denial of healthcare.

Maybe these ten reasons are why people are skeptical of vaccines, and free, honest and open discussion, along with informed consent, would be preferable.

The good news is that Ukraine caught their highest judge hiding some of his more than $2 million in bribes in pickle jars. The bad news is that Ukraine, consistently ranked as one of the most corrupt nations on the planet, still has high-ranking officials robbing it blind.

This might be a salient point when Ukraine returns to Congress to beg for more US taxpayer funds. Why won’t Democrats accept my call for a Special Inspector General to oversee the billions we send to Ukraine?

Apparently it is now a crime to make statements challenging election results if a prosecutor decides those statements aren’t true. 

So when should we expect indictments of the democrat politicians  who falsely claimed Russia hacked the 2016 election?
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
This week’s criminal indictments of former President Trump explicitly state that it is not a crime to challenge elections or to make false statements about them.

The indictments allege Trump and co-conspirators took actions to commit fraud and impede government functions.

When Biden responded to Trump in the debate that 5 former heads of the CIA and 51 former intelligence officials believed the Hunter Biden story was a Russian plant, it was an impressive talking point, because who could imagine that all those people would lie? Well now we know the answer to that question. If the security state won’t stop lying and interfering in American elections, perhaps it’s time to do what President John F Kennedy wanted — dismantle the whole thing and start over.

SHOCKING:  the Burisma accountant who was a cooperating witness set to testify in the Biden bribery scheme has been found dead.  

The woman, who was the wife of former executive Mykola Lisin, was found dead before she had a chance to testify.   Her Husband also died in 2011 in a mysterious car accident when Biden was VP.  Their son was also beaten and kidnapped in Kyiv, Ukraine.  Also, even though Lisin was an MP in Ukraine and prominent businessman, his entire history has been almost completely scrubbed from the internet. 

It’s starting to appear as if Biden will once again get away with it thanks to mysterious deaths and assistance from the FBI in hiding the details of the case.

NATO will change the status of the air force mission for the protection of the skies of the Baltic states to combat, Stoltenberg said. Previously, there was the status of the air police.

The so-called air police control the space above the Baltic states and are not considered a military mission. And with a combat mandate, NATO fighters will be able to participate in hostilities and be integrated into Lithuania's defense plans.

In addition, the German Defense Minister said that his country intends to deploy an additional 4,000 troops in Lithuania on a long-term basis.

BREAKING:  The Democrat Attorney General in Michigan didn’t reveal that her office had a team investigating a widespread voter fraud operation, even though she’s claimed many times that no widespread voter fraud existed in 2020.  

In 2020 a woman dropped off thousands of ballots to a county clerks office and the signatures were all similar and the addresses on a lot of them weren’t real.  What the investigation uncovered was massive.  A company being paid by democrats running operations in multiple states! 

The State Police found thousands of empty ballots, pre paid cards, money, and even weapons.  The woman claims she was being paid $1150/week to collect ballots from people.   

This is huge and the evidence showing a massive voter fraud operation is undeniable at this point.  The 2020 election should’ve never been certified!  Trump is innocent!

SHOCKING: New Study proves Pfizer mRNA induced turbo cancer

In a new Belgian study by Sander Eens et al. they injected 14 mice with 2 Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.

2 days after 2nd Pfizer dose, 1/14 mice (7%) died suddenly, had turbo cancer with lymphoma infiltration of many organs: liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs & intestines.

The turbo cancer mouse had shown no clinical signs of illness before sudden death.

This is the 2nd study to show turbo cancer after Pfizer mRNA vaccination. 

These were the types of studies that Pfizer & Moderna should have performed on mice but never did.

Key point: This 14 mouse study was larger than the study done to approve COVID-19 Omicron bivalent mRNA booster shots which were given to 100s of millions of people - that study only had 8 mice.

The study itself says it did not find evidence proving or refuting the link with cancer.
The single mouse that got cancer was already losing weight *before* getting vaccinated.  The other mice didn't lose weight.

Garland sends memo warning DOJ against talking to Congress | Just The News https://trib.al/wnDExVn
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The memo just reminded employees about a rule that was last updated in 2019, stemming from a 1939 law. Read the rule here:

justice.gov/jm/jm-1-8000-c…

In a separate memo, AG Garland banned political appointees from attending partisan campaign events, since the DOJ is supposed to be non-political.

You explicitly conflate trans identity with being sexual. It's gross dehumanization to reduce trans identity to a sexual thing and that's what you do every day. So yeah, you do call me ""groomer"" and ""pedophile"" because I'm trans just with a bs pretense. https://twitter.com/againstgrmrs/status/1565447360091754497…

Readers added context they thought people might want to know
There is no constitutional mechanism to “annul” Supreme Court Justices once they have been confirmed. The constitutional remedy is impeachment by congress, which does not invalidate their rulings. Furthermore, justices are only nominated by the POTUS, not appointed by him.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐞: “Amber lied about being sexually assaulted with a broken bottle / didn’t seek medical attention”

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐡: Amber never claimed she was penetrated with a broken bottle. Both in reports to medical professionals and in her testimony, she recalls disassociating during the assault and HOPING the bottle wasn’t broken as there was so much glass and broken bottles around them. The assertion she’s lying because she didn’t seek medical attention after the assault is a heinous victim blaming tactic that ignores the fact most women don’t seek medical attention after being raped. It’s also worth noting Depp kept a team of in-house nurses and doctors on-call that could privately treat him and his wife. This testimony of SA was previously sealed in the UK, yet Amber was forced to recall it on live television - in front of strangers and the world - in an attempt to discredit and humiliate her. I hate even having to address this incident because it’s so sensitive and private, but in the interest of providing factual information to dispel lies it felt necessary to include.

BOOM: President Biden took the gloves off against a Trump supporter, referring to him as ""sleepy Joe"" and accusing him of corruption. 

It is worth noting that it is quite amusing to witness a Trump supporter criticizing someone else's integrity. 

However, Dark Brandon eloquently countered these remarks and stood his ground, challenging the guy to push-ups. The Trump supporter expressed his intention not to vote for Biden, to which Biden astutely replied, I know you won't my friend you are too old. #DemVoice1 #wtpBLUE

Everything we said about Covid and its vaccination program turned out to be true:

You couldn't stop infection.
You couldn't stop transmission.
You couldn't prevent death.
You couldn't quarantine the virus.
You couldn't make places 'safe' with vaccine passports.
You couldn't stalk the virus with an app.
There were severe and unexpected reactions to the vaccine.
Curfews don't work on viruses.
Masks do more harm than good.
Too much hand sanitizer is bad for the skin.
Bottle shops are not safer than retail shops.
Lockdowns were destructive leading to economic and physical harm.
Almost all Covid rules were entirely pointless.
The government fines were illegal and are now being refunded.
Quarantine centres were a waste of money.
Our health experts acted like idiots.

Not a single meter should be left to them, because they use every meter for terror. It’s only Ukraine's victory that will return security. And this victory will come.

Why waste people’s man hours, if Twitter remains a trolling tool for its elite  A quick reminder of the Community Notes values:  Contribute to build understanding  Act in good faith  Be helpful, even to those who disagree|||Research suggests that fact-checking can correct perceptions among citizens, as well as discourage politicians from spreading false or misleading claims.  However, corrections may decay over time or be overwhelmed by cues from elites who promote less accurate claims.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking|||No Notes Needed.

Whether we as community notes contributors agree or disagree with this opinion is irrelevant.|||Stop trying to CN everything the man tweets. Challenge him in the replies you cowards.|||People at Community Notes are regarded by Elon also as a group of fact checkers whose task is to get to a consensus regarding a given tweet.    We don't consider ourselves as &quot;liars or being incredibly biased&quot; but a subgroup of users who want society to get true information always.|||Tweet is obviously an opinion, so a Note is obviously unnecessary. |||NNN. This is an opinion, based on a very real issue with &quot;fact checkers&quot; being incorrect on most things, labeling things true or false by twisting context or changing phrasing, and so on.

That's misleading and dishonest.

The majority of guns used in Chicago come from states with weak gun laws.

Bullets from handguns typically pierce straight through a target, medical experts say.

But higher caliber guns — like the AR-15s used in many mass shootings — can literally liquefy organs.

And the damage is much worse in children.

The effect of assault weapons is much greater in children, as the surface area of their organs and arteries are smaller, said Dr. Joseph Sakran, a trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

Under S.B. 8, doctors who terminate a pregnancy because of a medical emergency may face lawsuits. They must then prove—in court, by a preponderance of evidence—that the abortion was medically necessary.

A member of Congress claimed that there was no war on oil & gas because oil & gas companies are making record profits. But that's ridiculous. The reason for the record profits is due to high prices due to the shortage of supply, which is due to the war on oil & gas.

With every war going all the way back to Vietnam, the press has been heavily integrated with the troops and there's thousands of hours of live video footage. 

In Ukraine, nothing. 

We get no footage, no detailed updates, no graphs explaining how the war is going, who has control of what land, etc.

Or, Zelenskyy jet setting around the world to walk red carpets, get praised by the global elite, and pose for national magazine covers. 

If you question this - you're called a Putin puppet.

棄権者総数約4640万名、4800万は無効票約140万を誤算入している可能性があります。

棄権者がもし投票したとしたと仮定した場合の投票先は不明ですが、実際の投票先の比率と乖離が大きいことはありうるとしても、全数れいわということはほぼあり得ません。
れいわ新撰組当時の世論調査政党支持率0.5-2%程度で比例得票約3.86%でしたから、棄権層が投票したと推定するにしても棄権者のうち10%とかであればまだしも、80%とか100%というのは非現実的です。

We literally have no good way to extinguish Tesla fires. Because of a phenomenon called “thermal runaway” water doesn’t douse it. The fires just continue spontaneously for weeks after the accident.

原発処理水の放出にお墨付き…IAEAは本当に「中立」か 日本は巨額の分担金、電力業界も人員派遣

IAEAはどこまで信を置けるのか。かねて日本政府は、IAEAに巨額の分担金や拠出金を支出してきた。IAEAのお墨付きは、中立的な立場から出たと受け止めるべきか？

中立性に疑義を挟むのであれば、今年のIAEAの通常予算の分担率は日本に抗議した中国が14.7%、日本7.7%という前提を抑えて下さい。
また福島第一原発が２２兆ベクレル未満を予定しているのに対し、中国の秦山第３原発だけで約１４３兆ベクレル、他にも福島の数倍も排出している原発が林立しています。

NEW ARTICLE: Families that inject mRNA together, develop Turbo Cancer together?

12 unbelievable stories of two or three COVID-19 vaccinated family members developing aggressive turbo cancer at the same time!

It's happening. Turbo cancers are skyrocketing and some families will have two, even three members develop aggressive turbo cancer at Stage 4!

When multiple family members come down with cancer and a COVID-19 vaccine induced turbo cancer is suspected, always look for the presence of at least one of these: leukemia, lymphoma, brain cancer, breast cancer.

Presumably, if multiple family members went to get their COVID-19 vaccine at the same time, they may have received a “bad batch” or “hot lot”, a toxic pharmaceutical product with poor quality control that may have had too much mRNA or may have been contaminated with DNA plasmids containing the carcinogenic SV40 promoter!

The immune system damage and organ damage that those family members might then experience from a “bad vaccine batch” or a “hot lot”, may be similar and may give rise to turbo cancers in multiple family members.

割合表記では「母数が何か」が重要とされています。
toyokeizai.net/articles/-/833…

本ツイートに含まれる記事のタイトルの「4割」の母数は「総返納件数（247件）」ですが、明記されておらず「総発行件数」と誤認する恐れがあるので注意が必要です。

また、その他の返納は再発行や外国人の在留期間短縮にともなう返納であり、「本人希望（など）」という表現も誤認を生む恐れがあるので、こちらも注意が必要です。

中国にとって日本は水産物輸入先の10位にも入らないから禁輸は痛くない。日本の水産物を禁輸するのは中国だけでなく香港も。中国と香港で日本の水産物輸出額の半分近く（年間1600億円）を占める。しかもこれが何年も続く。普通に考えて放水は日本の政権が自国の漁業に大打撃を与えた失策。

The notion that a human being can be neither male nor female based on their own ineffable internal sense of neitherness is an tenet of gender ideology.

The Fed just announced it will introduce its “FedNow” Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in July. CBDCs grease the slippery slope to financial slavery and political tyranny.

While cash transactions are anonymous, a #CBDC will allow the government to surveil all our private financial affairs. The central bank will have the power to enforce dollar limits on our transactions restricting where you can send money, where you can spend it, and when money expires.

A CBDC tied to digital ID and social credit score will allow the government to freeze your assets or limit your spending to approved vendors if you fail to comply with arbitrary diktats, i.e. vaccine mandates.

The Fed will initially limit its CBDC to interbank transactions but we should not be blind to the obvious danger that this is the first step in banning and seizing bitcoin as the Treasury did with gold 90 years ago today in 1933.

Watch as governments, which never let a good crisis go to waste, use Covid-19 and the banking crisis to usher in a new wave of CBDCs as a safe haven from germ-laden paper currencies or as protection against bank runs.
